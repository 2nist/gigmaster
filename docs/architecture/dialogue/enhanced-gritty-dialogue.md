## ENHANCED ADULT DRAMA EVENTS

### Substance Abuse & Addiction

#### **First Hit**
*Early Game - Triggering Event*

Your guitarist comes up to you after the show, pupils dilated, talking faster than usual. "Dude, you HAVE to try this. I've never felt so... connected to the music. Like I could see the sound waves, you know?" 

They're holding out a small baggie. The venue's still buzzing with post-show energy, and several industry people are watching your interaction.

#### **The Groupie Situation**
*Mid Game*

After your show at {venue.name}, a young fan approaches you. They can't be older than 17, but they're throwing themselves at you like you're their salvation. "I've been following your tour," they breathe. "I have a hotel room. I have... things that might interest you."

Your manager sees what's happening and pulls you aside: "Kid, this could destroy everything. But... some of the biggest rock stars in history had their share of young admirers. Your call, but think about the optics."

He slides a business card across the sticky table. "Transport some packages on your tour. Easy money. $5000 per city, no questions asked. What you don't know can't hurt you, right?"

**Choices:**
- **"We're not criminals"** → He laughs. "Everyone's a criminal, kid. Some just haven't been caught yet." No immediate consequences, but you've made a powerful enemy

#### **The Pressure Cooker**
*Success Consequence Event*

You're three months into a world tour. Sold-out shows every night. Everyone wants a piece of you - interviews, photo shoots, meet-and-greets. You haven't slept more than 4 hours straight in weeks. You haven't been alone in months.

You're in your hotel room in Tokyo, and you can't remember what city you were in yesterday. Your hands are shaking. You catch yourself in the mirror and don't recognize the person staring back.

They include a photo of scars on their wrists and say "Every time I want to hurt myself, I listen to your voice instead."

But the letter is too detailed. Too intimate. They know things about you that weren't public. They mention your childhood trauma that you've never spoken about publicly. They say they feel "connected" to you in ways that make your skin crawl.

- **Ignore it completely** → Safe choice but you feel guilty. Affects mental health and songwriting inspiration

## GRITTY INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC EVENTS

### Label Exploitation

#### **The Contract**
*Major Label Interest*

The A&R rep slides a 47-page contract across the mahogany table. "Standard deal," he says with a smile that doesn't reach his eyes. "Seven albums, full creative control for the label, and we own your masters in perpetuity. But hey, $50,000 advance!"

Your lawyer (if you have one) points out the hidden clauses: You pay for everything - recording, promotion, videos - out of future royalties. The label can drop you anytime but you can't leave. If the album doesn't recoup costs, you owe them money.

"Take it or leave it. There's a dozen bands in the lobby waiting for this opportunity."

**Choices:**
- **Sign immediately - "We need this break"** → Get immediate money and promotion but become indentured servants. Long-term financial disaster
- **"Give us a week to think"** → They withdraw the offer. "This deal expires when you walk out that door."
- **Negotiate specific clauses** → Requires lawyer and music industry knowledge. High success rate if you have expertise, but risks angering the label
- **Walk away and stay independent** → Keep your dignity and masters but lose major label machine support

---

#### **The Payola Scheme**
*Radio Promotion*

Your label's radio promoter pulls you aside at a industry mixer. "Look, I like you kids. But radio play doesn't just happen anymore. The DJ at KROQ wants $5,000 to add your song to rotation. The program director at SirusXM wants concert tickets and backstage passes for his daughter's sweet sixteen."

"This is how the game is played. You want your music heard, you pay to play. The label can front the money, but it comes out of your royalties. What they don't tell you is that your competition is already paying double."

**Choices:**
- **"That's illegal, we won't participate"** → Maintain integrity but songs don't get radio play. Severely limited commercial success
- **Pay the bribes reluctantly** → Get radio play but become complicit in corrupt system. Debt to label increases
- **"Let's find another way"** → Try alternative promotion methods. Requires creativity and luck but maintains ethics
- **Document everything and expose the system** → Heroic choice that may reform industry but destroys your career and makes powerful enemies

### Manager Betrayal

#### **The Skim**
*Business Betrayal*

You're reviewing financial statements when something doesn't add up. Your manager has been taking 30% instead of the agreed 15%. But it's worse than that - they've been booking you at their friend's venues, inflating costs, and taking kickbacks from everyone.

The tour that you thought broke even? You actually lost $25,000. The "expensive" studio time? They got it half-price and pocketed the difference. They've stolen at least $100,000 over two years.

When confronted, they're unapologetic: "You'd still be playing coffee shops without me. This is the cost of success."

**Choices:**
- **"You're fired, and we're pressing charges"** → Legal battle drains money and time but might recover funds. Manager retaliates by badmouthing you to industry
- **"We're done, keep the money"** → Clean break but expensive lesson. Manager continues screwing over other artists
- **"Cut us in on the side deals"** → Become partners in corruption. More money but compromised integrity
- **Gather evidence before confronting** → Play it smart, document everything. Higher chance of legal success but they might catch on and destroy evidence

## LOCATION-SPECIFIC GRITTY EVENTS

### Dive Bar Drama

#### **The Regular**
*Venue: Dive Bar*

You're setting up at {venue.name} when the bartender warns you: "Watch out for Big Mike. He's been drinking since noon and he hates musicians. Last band that played here, he threw a chair at their amp."

Sure enough, ten minutes into your set, a massive drunk guy starts yelling: "TURN THAT NOISE DOWN!" When you keep playing, he starts pushing toward the stage. The bartender is tiny. The bouncer called in sick. There are about thirty people in the bar, and they're all watching to see what happens.

Big Mike is six-foot-six and has prison tattoos.

**Choices:**
- **Keep playing and hope for the best** → 60% chance he gets bored and leaves, 40% chance violence escalates
- **Stop and address him directly from stage** → Either defuses situation through humor/respect or makes you a target
- **Play his requests** → He demands "Free Bird" and other classic rock. Crowd loves it but you feel like a jukebox
- **Get the crowd to handle him** → Incite audience to police themselves. Could backfire spectacularly

---

### Warehouse Rave Chaos

#### **The Raid**
*Venue: Abandoned Warehouse*

You're two songs into your set at the underground venue when someone screams "COPS!" through a megaphone. The warehouse erupts in panic. People are running everywhere. You see someone shoving drug baggies down their pants. Someone else is smashing bottles against the wall.

The police lights are flashing outside, getting closer. Your gear is still plugged in. Your van is parked right out front with all your equipment inside.

**Choices:**
- **Grab your gear and run** → Might escape clean but equipment could be damaged in rush
- **Keep playing until they shut you down** → Go out like a legend but guarantee arrest. Become underground folklore
- **Help people escape through back exit** → Heroic choice that saves others but puts you at risk
- **Surrender immediately and cooperate** → Safest legal choice but you'll be labeled a snitch by the scene

### Stadium-Level Problems

#### **The Overdose**
*Venue: Major Stadium Show*

You're playing to 50,000 people when your security chief interrupts your soundcheck: "We have a situation. Kid collapsed in the front row. Looks like an overdose. Paramedics are working on them, but..." He shakes his head.

The kid is wearing your band t-shirt. They're maybe sixteen. The ambulance is pulling up to the venue entrance. Local news crews are arriving. Your show starts in thirty minutes.

If they die, it will be connected to your concert forever.

**Choices:**
- **Cancel the show out of respect** → Disappoint 50,000 fans and lose $500,000, but show humanity and respect for life
- **Dedicate the show to them** → Acknowledge the tragedy while continuing. Some will see this as exploitation, others as honoring them
- **No official statement, play as planned** → Avoid controversy but look callous. Media will create the narrative without you
- **Visit the hospital after the show** → Private gesture that might leak to media. Shows you care but could be seen as publicity stunt

## PSYCHOLOGICAL HORROR EVENTS

### Fan Obsession

#### **The Shrine**
*Fame Consequence*

A fan invites you to their apartment after a show. Seems normal enough - they want to show you their record collection. But when you arrive, the entire apartment is a shrine to your band. Every wall covered with photos of you. Some photos you've never seen before - taken with telephoto lenses outside your home.

They have a lock of hair in a frame that looks suspiciously like yours. They've written song lyrics on the walls in what looks like... is that blood?

"I know everything about you," they whisper. "We're connected. We're meant to be together forever."

The door locks with a deadbolt. You hear it click.

**Choices:**
- **Play along until you can escape** → Pretend to appreciate the shrine while looking for exit. Risky but might avoid violence
- **Confront them about the stalking** → Direct approach that might snap them back to reality or trigger violent response
- **Try to physically overpower them** → Risky but might be only escape. Could result in injury to both parties
- **Text your location to someone secretly** → Smart move if you can do it undetected, but if caught, escalates danger

---

### Mental Health Crisis

#### **The Voice**
*Success Pressure Event*

You're alone in your hotel room after another sold-out show. The crowds get bigger, but you feel smaller. You start hearing things - whispers, conversations that aren't there. At first, you think it's just exhaustion.

But tonight, the voice is clear: "They don't really love you. They love the idea of you. When they find out who you really are, they'll leave. Everyone always leaves."

You look around the empty luxury suite. Room service tray with untouched food. Phone full of messages from people who want something. When did success start feeling like solitary confinement?

**Choices:**
- **Call a mental health professional** → Responsible choice but admitting vulnerability in public eye has risks
- **Self-medicate with alcohol/drugs** → Temporary relief but starts dangerous spiral
- **Reach out to family/old friends** → Grounding connection but reveals how isolated you've become
- **Channel it into songwriting** → Creative outlet that might help process feelings but could romanticize mental illness
