## 💡 KEY INNOVATIONS

### **1. Psychological Realism**
Events aren't random - they're **magnetically attracted** to your psychological vulnerabilities. Play as a risk-taker? More dangerous opportunities appear. Show moral flexibility? Corruption offers multiply. The game becomes a psychological mirror.

### **2. Consequential Choices**
Every choice creates **ripple effects** that can surface weeks or months later. A small compromise in week 10 might lead to criminal investigation in week 50. Past decisions literally shape your future.

### **3. Adaptive Difficulty**
Bad choices don't just hurt stats - they **change the game**. Cross certain lines and you unlock darker events that weren't previously available. Recovery becomes genuinely difficult as your reputation precedes you.

### **4. Moral Complexity**
No choice is purely good or evil. The corrupt manager who steals from you might also save your career. The drugs that boost creativity might also inspire your greatest work. Every decision is genuinely difficult.
