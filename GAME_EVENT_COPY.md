## Notes on Copy Style

The GigMaster event copy employs several consistent narrative techniques:

### Tone & Voice
- **Conversational & authentic** - Characters speak naturally, not formally
- **Vivid details** - Specific sensory descriptions (crowd surfing, merch selling out, mosh pits)
- **Character perspective** - Events reveal personality through choices and consequences
- **Rock & Roll flavor** - Industry terminology mixed with emotional stakes

### Consequence Design
- **Moral/practical tension** - Most choices involve balancing money, morale, and fame
- **Meaningful tradeoffs** - No obvious "best" choice; each path has pros and cons
- **Narrative breadth** - Events span personal drama, business decisions, and creative choices
- **Modern relevance** - Updated events include streaming, social media, and NFTs

### Progression
- **Early game** - Personal drama, equipment issues, band dynamics
- **Mid-game** - Label interest, touring opportunities, creative decisions
- **Late-game** - Major partnerships, addiction/burnout, long-term success challenges
- **Modern layer** - Parallel track of digital opportunities and platform expansion

This creates a comprehensive narrative experience that captures both the creative and business sides of building a successful music career.
